## Powerful and lightweight 3D Engine

CHIFEngine is a feature-packed, cross-platform game engine to 3D games from a unified interface. It provides a powerful and lightweight Rendering Core and is written in python, so that users can focus on making powerful games without using much ressources and using simple syntax.

## Free and open source

CHIFEngine is completely free and open source under the very permissive GNU Public license v.3.0. No strings attached, no royalties, nothing. The users' games are theirs, down to the last line of engine code. CHIFEngine's development is fully independent and a hobby of us developers, empowering users to help shape their engine to match their imagination and expectations.

This Repo. is Maintained by Lukas R. and code by the CHIFEngine Class mates and the Maintainer, to create a good Gaming experience
