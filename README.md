## About CHIFEngine

[CHIFEngine](https://github.com/LL-Program/CHIF-Engine) is a versatile and feature-packed game engine designed to create stunning 3D games and immersive scenes. With a lightweight rendering core and a streamlined interface, it empowers developers to focus on creativity and performance.

Written in [C++](https://cplusplus.com/) and utilizing [Lua](https://www.lua.org/) for scripting production renders and its [C++ API](https://github.com/LL-Program/CHIF-Engine/tree/main/CHIFEngine) for Game Dev, CHIFEngine combines efficiency with simplicity, ensuring developers can create powerful games without overloading system resources.

## Why CHIFEngine?

- **Free and Open Source**: CHIFEngine is licensed under the MIT License, allowing complete freedom with no royalties or hidden fees, just the same License.
- **Developer-Friendly**: Easy-to-learn Lua scripting paired with C++ ensures both beginner and advanced developers feel at home.

> *"Powering the next Dimension. Faster than C itself."*
